# Traverse-MBP-extractor
Traverse Extractor for Mandarin Blueprint accounts


I´ll add more info later but by now if you want to try the extension it´s as easy as:

    1. Download the zip file
    2. Unzip the file into a folder
    3. Go into Chrome > More Tools > Extensions > Activate "Developer Mode"
    4. Click on "Load unpacked" or click into the Extensions symbol (like a puzzle piece) on the tool bar and click on "Manage Extensions" and click on "Load unpacked" there.
    5. Select the folder you extracted into (probably called "mandarin-blueprint-traverse-extractor") and it will appear as an icon with an M at your browser bar.
    6. Go into Traverse, navigate to a page and click on the extension icon, then Alt+G or press the 'Grab it!' button.
